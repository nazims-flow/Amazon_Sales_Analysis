 Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
 data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
 understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
 ## Introduction
 This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
 information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
 leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
 uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
 ## Dataset Overview
 The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing Amazon
 sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
 products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
 missing values and ensure data quality.
 ## Analysis Questions Resolved
 During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
 analysis techniques:

 An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
 the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
 helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.
 ## Getting Started
 To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
 2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
 3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
 5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
 ## Conclusion
 Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer
 preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset
 and addressing the key questions, we hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions
 and optimizing their sales strategies.
